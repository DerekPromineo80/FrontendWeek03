/* Using this to make the placeholder lighter */



/* 
Turns out, you can just use an attribute inline with 

style="font-weight: lighter" 

within the input element attributes using the existing Bootstrap.
It has the same effect as using this CSS. It makes not only the 
'placeholder text' lighter, but also the little box with it,
as well as any of the text you may enter.

Therefore, I turned this "off" by commenting it out. 
If you think about it, this uses less code, but it adds a file,
and since you are already using Bootstrap, it works. 
If there were hundreds of form inputs I would use this instead of
inlining the attribute in each of the input tags.
