Hello!

Welcome to Derek McGuire's Week 3 Repository!

This is the repository for the Week 3 Coding Assignment (Bootstrap).

The Week 3 Coding assignment required the use of the Bootstrap Grid, and a Navbar, Table, and Form.

Bootstrap is a framework for CSS that provides libraries that you can implement in your HTML code.

Enjoy!
